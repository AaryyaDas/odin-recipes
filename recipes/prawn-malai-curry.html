    <h4><strong>About the dish: </strong></h4>Chingri malai curry or malai chingri, also known as prawn malai curry, is a Bengali curry made from tiger and king prawns and coconut milk and flavoured with spices. Originating from the Bengali speaking regions of Pre-partition 'Bangla', now West Bengal and Bangladesh, this delectably sweet and aromatic dish takes seafood to a whole new level.

    <h4><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound tiger prawns, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 whole cloves</li>
        <li>4 green cardamom pods</li>
        <li>2 pieces of stick cinnamon (1&frac12; inches each)</li>
        <li>1 onion, grated</li>
        <li>1&frac14; teaspoons ginger paste</li>
        <li>1&frac14; teaspoons garlic paste</li>
        <li>&frac12; teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>&frac14; teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup finely chopped tomato</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ghee (clarified butter)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4><strong>Steps:</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <li> To prepare fresh garam masala, in a coffee grinder, grind cardamom seeds, 3 whole cloves, and 3 cinnamon sticks to a fine powder. Set aside. </li>
        <li> Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add 4 whole cloves, 4 cardamom pods, and 2 sticks of cinnamon and fry for a few seconds (take care as cloves tend to pop out of the pan). Stir in grated onion and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook and stir until liquid dries and onion no longer smells raw, about 5 minutes. Add ginger paste and garlic paste and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. </li>
        <li> Stir in turmeric and cayenne pepper. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until tomatoes are soft, about 5 minutes. Pour in water, cover the pan, and cook for an additional 5 minutes. </li>
        <li> Pour in coconut milk and stir well. When mixture is just below boiling, stir in prawns. Sprinkle mixture with almost all of the fresh garam masala powder, reserving a pinch to use as a garnish. Gently stir to combine. Do not cover the pan at this stage, as coconut milk will curdle. </li>
        <li> As soon as prawns are pink and cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes, add ghee. Remove the pan from the heat. Sprinkle reserved garam masala over the dish and serve with rice or by itself. </li>
    </ol>
